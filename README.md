### Group Members: Courtney Bowser, Shelby, Jon Damron, John Sperkowski, and Gloria Phan 
### Group Mentor: Val Boaten

## Overview: 
In today’s world, where technology is quickly evolving, people easily get lost in their handheld devices and lose track of how much time they spend on those devices. As such, time management and productivity may become a major problem. To solve this problem, we are creating an all-in-one time management program.  It covers all bases for time management: a calendar for long term planning, an organized list of your to-do tasks for the day, and a workflow timer to help improve your productivity on completing those tasks. 

This app will be all you need for personal time management. It will keep you on track with a timer that alerts you when it is time for a break; it will showcase a calendar that focuses on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly planning. Not to mention it will have a journal entry spot for those days when you simply need to vent. This app will also reward you for using it, and give you that satisfaction for doing exactly what you want to be doing.

## Features:
* Workflow Timer: Different timers for workflow(Pomodoro, GTD, etc)
* Calendar / Time Planner: The user should be able to search activities on their calendar, The user should be able to create an event on their calendar
* User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. 
* Task Prioritization(To Do List): Daily To Do list with small tasks. Tasks can be ordered by priority. 
* Online Journal: Space to journal and vent about anything throughout the work day.
* Optional/Bonus- Rewards/Badges: Give the user points/badges for completing tasks, using timers, etc. Have those stats saved to their user data/profile.

## Technologies: 
* Javascript/Angular Front-end
* C#/MySQL Back-end
